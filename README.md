I successfully completed the Data Management and Visualization course on July 17, 2020. As part of the coursework, I conducted a research project utilizing either Python or SAS. Given my interest in learning SAS, I selected it as the primary tool for my research. I chose to find is there any associtation between PD and being raised without biological parents. 


Personality Disorder (PD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent, pervasive patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior that significantly deviate from cultural norms and cause distress or impairment in functioning. Individuals with PD often struggle to understand and relate to situations and others, leading to difficulties in relationships, work, and social activities. In many cases, individuals with PD may not recognize their own condition, perceiving their behavior as normal. Conversely, they may blame others for the challenges they face.

Symptoms of PD typically emerge during adolescence or early adulthood.

The causes of PD are complex and multifaceted. Childhood trauma, including verbal abuse and high reactivity, are widely recognized as significant risk factors. Additionally, emerging research suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of PD.

Childhood experiences, particularly those involving parental absence or neglect, can have a profound impact on personality development. Every individual deserves a nurturing and supportive childhood, as it serves as the foundation for a healthy and fulfilling life

I created two variable VAR_1(which represents the individuals raised without biological parents) & VAR_2 (which represents the individuals have personality disorders who raised without biological parents). Here VAR_1 is independent variable & VAR_2 is response variable. A weak positive association between VAR_1 & VAR_2 was found.
